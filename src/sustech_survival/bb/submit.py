sustech_survival.bb.submit — REST-based BB assignment submission (no Playwright).

This module is the single BB submitter. The legacy Playwright-driven
submitter and the ``bb._playwright`` module were removed; the pure-REST
path (formerly ``bb.submit_rest``) was moved here.

Status (2026-06-08): WORKING. End-to-end REST submission succeeds with file attached.

The two-step flow that BB's JS uses internally:

  1. GET /webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?action=newAttempt&...
     → returns the upload form HTML, including CSRF nonces and hidden fields
  2. POST /webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?action=submit
     → multipart/form-data POST with ALL hidden fields + the file as
       the multipart part named `newFile_LocalFile0`

The "magic" fields that BB's file picker adds to the form when a file is staged
(see /javascript/ngui/widget.js → preparePickedFilesForSubmit / getPickedFiles):

  newFile_attachmentType         = 'L'          (LOCAL — file is in the multipart)
  newFile_fileId                 = 'new'        (placeholder for new file)
  newFile_artifactFileId         = 'undefined'  (string, not a JS undefined)
  newFile_artifactType           = 'undefined'
  newFile_artifactTypeResourceKey= 'undefined'
  newFile_linkTitle              = <target filename>  (the link title shown in BB)
  newFile_LocalFile0             = <file binary>      (the actual file)
  dispatch                       = 'submit'           (set by submitAssignment JS)

For BB's server, the file goes in the multipart envelope (just like the
Playwright path's form.submit() call) — the file is attached to the attempt
based on the field name `newFile_LocalFile0`, not on the form's <input id>.
Without the field name, the file is silently dropped (the existing submit_rest.py
"works but no file" symptom).

CSRF: the `blackboard.platform.security.NonceUtil.nonce` field must match the
session-bound nonce. It changes on every GET of the upload page, so we always
GET a fresh form before POSTing.

Submission-semantics rules (ported from sustech-cli v0.11.1,
blackboard-assignment-form.ts + blackboard-submission.ts):

  R1 — Verify the exact assignment target BEFORE any POST. Resolve the
       course AND the content (or column) and confirm it is the accessible
       assignment; only after that do we trust the upload form. An initial
       attempts-list 404 is treated as "no attempts yet" ONLY after both the
       assignment and its blank first-submission view form have been verified.
       Every other error during pre-flight stays an error.
  R2 — Never automatically replay the submission POST, including across
       HTTP redirects. ``allow_redirects=False`` on the multipart POST and
       no retry decorator on the failure path.
  R3 — The error shown to the user keeps the failure stage plus a
       sanitized upstream status and path. Raw HTML responses, nonces,
       cookies, and credential-bearing query strings are NEVER dumped
       into the user-visible message.
  R4 — Keep the reviewed file's SHA-256 and refuse to submit if the bytes
       changed between preview and apply. A distinct exception class
       (``FileChangedSinceReviewError``) carries the computed hashes so
       the caller can report what the user actually has on disk now.
  R5 — Text and comment submissions use the editor field the fetched form
       actually exposes. If the expected text/comment editor is absent
       from the form, fail with a clear error — never silently send
       nothing.

            under this name before POSTing.
        dry_run: if True, GET the form + simulate the POST, but don't actually
            submit. Returns a DRY_RUN SubmitResult.
        skip_dedup: no-op for the REST path (REST doesn't do a per-attempt
            dedup like the old Playwright path did). Preserved for API parity.

    Notes:
        - Stops at the first sign of trouble with explicit error messages.
        - File is staged under target_name in
          ~/.sustech_survival/cache/bb/submits/ so the
          BB-side filename matches.
        - Rule R2: the multipart POST is sent exactly once with
          ``allow_redirects=False``; no retry, no replay on redirect.
        - Rule R3: errors carry the failing stage plus a sanitized upstream
          status and path — raw HTML is never echoed to the user.
